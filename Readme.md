## Overview
Week 4 explores advanced features of Java, including generics for type safety, the collections framework for data management, file and stream IO, regular expressions for pattern matching, unit testing with JUnit, and modern Java 8 features such as lambdas and streams. Mastery of these topics is crucial for writing efficient, readable, and testable Java code.

## Topics Covered
Day 1: Generics

Introduction to generics and type parameters

Creating generic classes and methods

Type safety and code reusability

Real-world examples: MarketPlace, WarehouseItem, Resume, Storage, University, Meal, Waste, Electronics, Furniture, Groceries

Day 2: Collections Framework

List, Set, Map, and Queue interfaces

ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap, PriorityQueue, etc.

Common operations: adding, removing, searching, iterating, sorting, grouping, merging, and set operations

Practical applications: ShoppingCart, BankingSystem, GroupByDepartment, InsurancePolicySystem, VotingSystem, WordFrequencyCounter, HospitalTriage, StackUsingQueues, SetOperations, SetEquality

Day 3: IO Streams and Exception Handling

File reading and writing (text and binary files)

Serialization and deserialization

Streams: InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer

Exception handling: try-catch, finally, multiple catch blocks, custom exceptions, checked vs unchecked exceptions, try-with-resources

Example programs: FileReadWrite, EmployeeSerialization, LargeFileReader, StudentDataStream, BankTransactionSystem, CustomExceptionExample, NestedTryCatchExample

Day 4: Regular Expressions and JUnit Testing

Regex basics: pattern matching, validation, extraction, replacement

Common regex tasks: email validation, date extraction, censoring words, extracting numbers and currency, finding repeating words

Unit testing with JUnit: writing and running test cases, assertions, parameterized tests, exception testing, test coverage

Example programs: ExtractEmails, ValidateCreditCard, ReplaceMultipleSpaces, CensorBadWords, BankAccountTest, CalculatorTest, PasswordValidatorTest, ExceptionHandlingTest

Day 5: Java 8 Features

Lambda expressions and functional interfaces

Stream API: filtering, mapping, reducing, collecting

Method references and default/static methods in interfaces

Practical applications: BookRecommendations, EmployeeDataProcessing, RiskAssessment, BiFunctionExample, PredicateCompositionExample, MapReduceExample, FilterListExample, SortPersonExample

## Prerequisites
Completion of Week 3 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed

Familiarity with Java basics, OOP, and core data structures
